    "The coefficients in elastic net regression represent the effect of each predictor variable on the target variable, considering the regularization penalties imposed. Here's how to interpret the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Magnitude of Coefficients**:\n",
    "   - The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the effect of a predictor on the target variable. A larger magnitude suggests a stronger influence.\n",

    "2. **Sign of Coefficients**:\n",
    "   - The sign (positive or negative) of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between the predictor variable and the target variable. Positive coefficients imply a positive effect, while negative coefficients imply a negative effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Coefficients**:\n",
    "   - Due to the L1 (LASSO) penalty, some coefficients may be exactly zero, effectively excluding the corresponding predictors from the model. This implies that those predictors have no contribution to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison of Magnitudes**:\n",

    "5. **Balance between LASSO and Ridge Contributions**:\n",
