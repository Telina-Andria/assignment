Therefore, you cannot directly compare the magnitudes of coefficients to determine their relative importance. Instead, you can compare the magnitudes of coefficients within the same model to assess their relative importance. Coefficients with larger magnitudes are generally considered more important in relation to other coefficients within the model.\n"

    "2. Moving Window Ridge Regression: This approach involves fitting a separate ridge regression model to a sliding window of the time-series data. The window moves along the time axis, and at each step, a new model is fit to the data within the window. This can help to capture the changes in the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable over time.\n",

    "3. Time-dependent Ridge Regression: This approach involves modifying the penalty term in the ridge regression objective function to account for the temporal dependencies in the data. For example, a penalty term that depends on the difference between adjacent time points can be used to encourage smoothness in the estimated coefficients over time.\n",
