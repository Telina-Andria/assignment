    "Difference between REST and SOAP are:\n",
    "1) Structure of the message: REST uses the HTTP protocol and sends messages in a lightweight and easily readable data format, such as JSON or XML. This makes the messages simple and straightforward, which is ideal for lightweight and simple web applications. On the other hand, SOAP architecture uses protocols such as TCP, SMTP, and HTTP to establish communication between the client and server. Messages sent by SOAP are typically in XML format, a structured and text-based data format. This makes them more complex and secure than REST messages, which makes them more suitable for more complex web applications that require advanced features such as security and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Statelessness: REST: REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process that request. The server does not retain any information about the client's state between requests. SOAP, by itself, does not inherently enforce statelessness\n",
    "3) Standards and Contracts: REST: REST does not prescribe a specific set of standards or contracts for communication between clients and servers. SOAP, on the other hand, is based on a set of rigid standards and requires a formal contract (WSDL - Web Services Description Language) that defines the operations, data types, and endpoints. This contract needs to be agreed upon by both the client and server before communication can occur.\n",
    "4) Flexibility: REST is known for its flexibility and simplicity, making it easier to develop and understand. It allows for a wide range of data formats and supports various authentication methods, including token-based authentication and OAuth. SOAP's strict standards and contract-based approach can make it less flexible in some cases. However, it offers more built-in security features like WS-Security, which can be essential in certain enterprise-level scenarios."
